Selah Devotionals' Vision is to make Gospel and Christian Resources
more accessible to people. This is not intended to replace your favorite devotional app, but rather compliment them. It has 7 Sections.

Section 1: Random Bible Verse. 
This is useful when you want to
simply refresh yourself with inspiring Bible Verses, or you want to share a Scripture snippet to someone else.

Section 2: Online Services. 
This compiles preaching resources
from different Churches. I am so blessed with these Churches and I always listen to these Podcasts. Churches included are:
    - JSOS
    - Elevation
    - Transformation
    - Passion
    - Victory. 
I pray that God will use these messages to empower you too

Section 3: Prayer Journal. 
You can create, edit and delete custom Prayer Items.

Section 4: Devotionals. 
This compiles resources from free devotional RSS feeds. 
    - Word Points
    - Devotional Treasure

are the RSS feeds included.

    - Christian News Journal

    - Voice of Martyrs,

Section 6: Christian Music.

Section 7: Bible, Science, End Times.

    - Answers in Genesis
    - Kent Hovind 
tackling Science and the Bible, and the End Times. The resources used here are free. Hence, I should not be violating laws. However, if you're one of the authors of the resources used in this app, and you're not comfortable with it, please contact me. I'll be happy to comply with whatever we discuss.

The application itself doesn't have ads. If you see ad from any page, those ads are owned by the resources used. All income will be credited to them. Let's support them.

This app is still in early stage, and I'm doing it in my free time. Please be patient with me for any bug. Please file them, and I'll try to fix as soon as I can. If you're a developer, you can issue PR(s) to improve the codebase, or add new features. You may contact me for source code. Also, Youtube has a  threshold for maximum API calls we can do. If ever the sections with Youtube suddenly didn't work, we might have reached the limit already. Please come back after another day, and the limit should have reset. Please bare with me. Hehehehe.

If you read some resources that aren't Biblical, please report it to me, so I can review them.

Future plan (very long term): Add Praise and Prayer Walls.
Add social network where we can chat each other for counseling and prayer.
