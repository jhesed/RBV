My android app's vision is to make Devotional resources more reachable to people.  Hence, I compiled free RSS / youtube videos from different Christian groups, and grouped them by category, for easier access.  The actual videos itself will be played using the installed youtube app in the device.

Included youtube videos are Online Worship Services, Christian Songs, and Theologies from:
- JSOS Church
- Elevation Church
- Transformation Church
- Passion Church
- Hillsong Church
- Victory Church

1. User opens the Selah Devotionals App
2. User clicked "Online Services" Section and the sub tabs in it
2.1. App calls Youtube API to fetch most recent playlist of channel (1 API call times 5 churches; cached for 6 hours)
2.2. App fetches latest X videos from playlist from 2.1 (1 API call times 5 churches; cached for 6 hours)

3. User clicked "Christian Music" Section and the sub tabs in it
3.1. App calls Youtube API to fetch most recent playlist of channel (1 API call times 5 churches; cached for 6 hours)
3.2. App fetches latest X videos from playlist from 2.1 (1 API call times 5 churches; cached for 6 hours)


4. User clicked "Bible, Science, End Times" Section and the sub tabs in it
4.1. App calls Youtube API to fetch most recent playlist of channel (1 API call times 5 churches; cached for 6 hours)
4.2. App fetches latest X videos from playlist from 2.1 (1 API call times 5 churches; cached for 6 hours)

---------------
2 Calls for each displayed playlist (1 for retrieving most recent playlist, the other for fetching the actual videos)
There are 5 churches for each tab.  Breakdown per User

2 x 5 calls for Online services = 10
2 x 5 calls for Christian Music = 10
2 x 5 calls for Bible, Science, End Times = 10

Total: 30 units per user cached per day

Total number of Christians around the world:  ~2Billion
Total number of Youversion app (as reference to possible number of users: 300 million)

Total target of initial users: 10000
= 10,000 x 30 = 300,000 units

NOTE:
The app just launched today and have 0 users. The current quota will only support 333 users. I want to request to extend it while we're in the initial phase.  After the approval, I plan on endorsing it to multiple churches around the globe. In Elevation Church alone,  there are 14000 members.  I want them to use the app without experiencing the quota limit.

3 sections of the android app won't work

Initially, I used the "search" functionality.  But it cost me 100 units per call.  Since there are 15 channels, that's 1500 units per user.  I already optimized it to use get playlist and videos APIs, which only cost 30 units.  Also, I added caching as well.
Total target of initial users: 10000
= 10,000 x 30 = 300,000 units
